# Easy Augmented Reality with Moodstocks and Vuforia

## Overview

This project allows the combined use of the Moodstocks SDK and the Vuforia SDK in order to easily add augmented reality effects on top of the image recognition.

It is based on the image recognition provided by the Moodstocks SDK and will allow you, upon recognition, to decide whether you want to:

- handle this recognition event by yourself, as if the Vuforia SDK was not there, or
- display a picture in augmented reality on the recognized image using the Vuforia SDK, or
- play a video in augmented reality on the recognized image <i>(experimental feature)</i> using the Vuforia SDK.

## Compatibility

* iOS 5.0+
* Android 4.0+

## How to use

You should follow our [Augmented Reality Guide](https://moodstocks.com/documentation/user-guides/augmented-reality/) to get started with this framework!
